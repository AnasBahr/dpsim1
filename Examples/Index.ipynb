    "# DPsim\n",
    "\n",
    "DPsim is a real-time capable power system simulator that operates in the dynamic phasor (DP) and EMT domain. This solver primarily targets co-simulation and large-scale scenarios since dynamic phasor variables do not require sampling rates as high as EMT simulations. Due to the frequency shift introduced by the DP approach, the sampling rate and rate of data exchange between simulators can be reduced. Thus, it is also possible to simulate high frequencies introduced by power electronics with lower sampling rates than in EMT simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "DPsim supports the CIM format as native input for the description of electrical network topologies, component parameters and load flow data, which is used for initialization. For this purpose, CIM++ is integrated in DPsim. Users interact with the simulation kernel via Python bindings, which can be used to script the execution, schedule events, change parameters and retrieve results. Supported by the availability of existing Python frameworks like Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib, Python scripts have been proven as an easy and flexible way to codify the complete workflow of a simulation from modelling to analysis and plotting, for example in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DPsim simulation kernel is implemented in C++ and uses the Eigen linear algebra library. By using a system programming language like C++ and a highly optimized math library, optimal performance and real-time execution can be guaranteed.\n",
    "The integration into the [VILLASframework](http://fein-aachen.org/projects/villas-framework/) allows DPsim to be used in large-scale co-simulations.\n",

    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the examples collection of DPsim. These examples are a good way to start using DPsim.\n",
    "\n",
    "They cover DPsim's feature from [simple circuits](./Notebooks/Circuits/CS_R2CL.ipynb) and to more complex benchmarks models like the [IEEE/WSCC 9-bus system](./Notebooks/Grids/WSCC_9-bus_dyn_switch_python.ipynb).\n",
